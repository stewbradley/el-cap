FAQ
---

El CapÂ is an early-stage (pre-seed/seed) VC firm focused on backing deeply technical founders building near collisions of innovation and behavior change in B2B, cloud infrastructure, developer tools, and web3 markets. El Cap gets involved at a project level with each investment, targets double-digit ownership in core investments, and takes board seats at the Seed round. We created aÂ Contributors ProgramÂ with industry-leading experts in engineering, design, research, security, and GTM to help our portfolio companies move faster at the earliest stages. Our first fund has made great progress, currently valued at 11.5x. Weâ€™re actively raising our second fund, have done a first close, and have made five new investments out of our second fund.

### **Whatâ€™s unique about El Cap relative to other funds?**

***We have unique deal flow through:***

- [Our Contributor Network](https://elcap.xyz/contributors)- we have people that we share carry with in our fund who work at or have worked with industry leading companies like: Facebook, Google, Scale, Browser Company, Notion, Slack, Discord, Square, and many more. This provides us the opportunity to connect with founders very early, often before they even commit to starting a company
- Our portfolio companies- we believe what Founders say and think about El Cap is critical to our business. Maintaining a great reputation with the Founders we work with, and even the ones we pass on, in turn leads to a great source of deal flow with high signal endorsement attached
- Our relationships with builders and engineers. As a firm that only focuses on deeply technical founders, we spend a lot of time talking and dreaming alongside with the people who can build the future
- We believe that **the best way to deploy capital at the early stage is to play offense, and not wait for deals to flow to you**. Itâ€™s important to us to not be viewed as just capital, but as participants in the larger ecosystem of builders and tinkerers. Identifying talent on GitHub, joining online communities (Seed Club, Yieldopolis, DPS, Cabin, Solidity Guild, Reforge, Recurse Center, etc), actively meeting people through Telegram chats and Twitter are all critical to how we build relationships early, and continue to grow El Capâ€™s brand and reputation with the people on the ground who are building products.

***We support founders in a few ways:***

- **Believing early.** We are conviction based investors, who look to lead, and donâ€™t need anyone else to have committed to say yes. We are happy to catalyze a round before itâ€™s obvious to the rest of the world.
- **High touch.** Because we have a concentrated investment strategy, it enables us to spend more time with the founders we back. Higher frequency engagement, higher level of context in each business, higher trust between our team and their own. This makes us prepared to efficiently help as situations arises, without additional context setting from founders.
- **Contributors.** The El Cap contributors program is an industry-first program that is focused on how to help founders post-investment, by giving them access to valuable insights, learnings, and best practices that are often siloed inside more mature companies. Itâ€™s not a scout program, and it is not a venture services platform, itâ€™s our community based approach to helping founders move faster, while avoiding many mistakes along the way.

### **What kind of founders do we back?**

Backing quality founders matters more than anything else in early-stage investing. At pre-seed/seed, you aren't investing in what the company **has done** but in what it **will do**. Given this dynamic, we believe itâ€™s more important to focus on how quickly a team is moving rather than how far they have come. What matters is the rate of change, the derivative. How quickly is the team taking in information and generating logical and actionable insights? And how quickly do they translate those insights into execution?

We solely focus on backing deeply technical founders. Weâ€™re looking for the giga-brain founders who tackle new problems and knowledge gaps with ferocity. People who are attracted to hard problems and challenges that others shy away from. Folks who are looking for the edges and eager to forge into uncharted territory.

### **Whoâ€™s working on it?**

Co-Founders: [Stew Bradley](https://stew.so/) and [Kunal Tandon](http://twitter.com/kunaltandon). Learn more about us and how we think about investing in our [**Foundersâ€™ Letter**](https://mirror.xyz/0xA00D13D2067F6D6afAF4705A624117Cf962B2515/cQ_XguVBHt9VEv1JjN95V8cmFhWrxfVoVm-FdOk7kVI).

### **How do you think about El Cap as a firm?** 

Raising and deploying a fund is not sufficient to driving great returns. Access to the best founders and the ability to pick them is also insufficient. In a venture market that is more crowded than ever before, itâ€™s critical to think about oneâ€™s firm as a productâ€”similar to the way we evaluate potential investments. How are we different? How do we win? How do we learn? How do we add real value? Why would someone pick us instead of another product in the market? These are the questions we are obsessed with at El Cap. Weâ€™re hyper-focused on expanding and refining the system weâ€™ve created to find, diligence, invest, and then support the best companies at the earliest stages. Weâ€™re obsessed with constantly learning and improving how we approach this job every single day. 

Hereâ€™s what we tell founders they can always expect from us:

- **Transparency**- around our process, around our decision-making, and in our ongoing interactions with them
- **Responsiveness**- our job is to be helpful to founders when they need it. Responding to emails, providing feedback, making intros, finding time for a call, or just serving as a soundboard in moments of stress or euphoria. We strive to make ourselves available to our founders when they need us.
- **Support**- building at the earliest stages is difficult, challenging, and often isolating. We consistently encourage founders to leverage us a trusted resource, to be open, to be honest, and to be vulnerable. Our high frequency of engagement with founders often helps build closer and more transparent relationships.

### **Which VC firms do you admire?**

As a firm that values a small partnership, being thoughtful about fund size, leading deals, having a concentrated approach, and building in public, we take a lot of inspiration from the durable and enduring partnerships that Union Square Ventures and Benchmark have built. Additionally, while we donâ€™t know what the future of our industry looks like, we are confident that it will look radically different over the next ten years, and that itâ€™s our job to always be revisiting our underlying assumptions. We are obsessed with thinking about how we build a firm that is attractive to the best founders, and oriented towards supporting them on their journey. No firm has done a better job at this over a very long period than Sequoia. Said more simply, we have ambitions to be a historically great firm over multiple funds.

### **Research as a differentiator:**

Seeing the benefit of ***good research*** habits for startups has been one of our key learnings since starting the [Contributorâ€™s program](https://contributors.super.site/). Rational yet efficient decision-making is a complex balancing act that requires frequent diagnosis and realignment. Good research is the process of gathering and synthesizing evidence in service of making decisions. This is something that many of us do on a regular basis, whether thatâ€™s deciding where to go on vacation, choosing what to wear for the day, orâ€”in the context of organizationsâ€”identifying how to best serve customers.

A companyâ€™s research practice starts the moment a founder has an idea. They ask themselves who else might have this problem? How many of these people exist? How have they tried to solve it? What worked or didnâ€™t work about those solutions? Whether theyâ€™re aware of it or not, theyâ€™ve already been doing research. But that research probably felt unstructured, yielding useful evidence in inconsistent ways. 

We have two El Cap Contributors who specialize in research. With them as a guide, weâ€™re developing a research playbook. A set of case studies, question templates, and frameworks that our founders can leverage as they hunt for product market fit. 

In general, research tends to follow these steps:

- Identify what decision you need to make
- Identify what evidence you need to make that decision confidently
- Identify what evidence you do not have and need to go gather
- Plan an approach to go out and collect that evidence
- Execute the approach
- Synthesize your learnings
- Make your decision (and document things!)

The specific approaches can vary a lot depending on the desired outcome. Do you want to observe user behavior or have customers share their attitudes and perspectives? Would you rather go deep with a few individuals or go broad with hundreds? People mistakenly believe that research is only about learning. Learning is critical to research, but there many things you can spend time learning that will have little impact on your actual business, product, or customers. Defining the purpose of your research efforts, and constructing a process that matches those goals is vital. To help on this front, more than half our portfolio has worked with our Research Contributors, to define and implement light weight research practices. The feedback has been unanimously positive.  

### **SPVs:**

Through our normal course of business we encounter smart founders and interesting companies that have matured beyond our strike zone for a Fund II investment. Rather than let these opportunities lay fallow, we offer LPs the opportunity to invest in these companies via SPVs. We have deployed $7m of capital through this channel, and are actively exploring a few of these deals each quarter. We believe these type of deals are attractive on a stand alone basis, and add high quality nodes to our network. 

Carrying the through line of *playing offense*, weâ€™ve built a big board of 25 later-stage companies we would be excited to invest in. The big board is a living list that we update monthly with input from founders, Contributors, and other investors. It allows us and our Contributors to be efficient with our interactions and move quickly when opportunities arise.
